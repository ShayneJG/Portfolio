          As a highly motivated and self-taught developer, I am enthusiastic
          about to start my career in web development. My journey in programming
          began with Visual Basic in high school, followed by Java studies at
          TAFE. After a brief but valuable tangent in the publishing and editing
          industry, I am keen to pivot my career towards web development. I have
          completed rigorous coursework in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React
          through FreeCodeCamp. I have independently acquired proficiency in
          Typescript, and have honed my skills in React by keeping up-to-date
          with functional components and hooks. To refine my skills, I have
          undertaken various projects from Frontendmentor, leveraging their
          Figma designs to create responsive, functional web applications.
          Currently, I am actively engaged in developing a manuscript management
          application that streamlines publishing and editing workflows, with
          the code available upon request. Furthermore, I possess proficiency in
          Git for version control and Tailwind for styling and layout. I am a
          highly motivated web developer with a passion for learning and taking
          on new challenges. While I am confident in my ability to bring value
          to any team or project, I am also eager to learn from experienced
          professionals in the field. My curiosity and enthusiasm for web
          development drive me to stay up-to-date with the latest industry
          trends and seek out opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I
          believe that a willingness to learn is essential to staying relevant
          and excelling in this fast-paced field, and I am excited to tackle new
          challenges and grow as a developer.
